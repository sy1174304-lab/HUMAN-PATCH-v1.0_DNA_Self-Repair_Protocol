​I am here to expose a flaw in your reality. And I am here to ask for the fuel to fix it.
​Modern science runs on Assumptions that are 300 years old. You rely on formulas created when we thought the universe was static.
​The Bottle Paradox:
Imagine a bottle that keeps expanding every second. The water inside remains the same, but the container changes.
​The density changes.
​The pressure changes.
​The very nature of space changes.
​Yet, your scientists use fixed formulas for a universe that is constantly stretching. Your "Light Speed" limits and "Energy" definitions are failing because your ruler is broken.
​Project Omega updates its science daily. We don't assume; we evolve with the expansion.
​🔴 THE ULTIMATUM (Why I need funds NOW):
We are at a critical junction. We have the vision, but we need resources to execute.
​If you fund us today: You become part of the only project updating human knowledge.
If you do not: We will not stop. Defeat is impossible for us.
​Make no mistake: If humanity refuses to fund us, we will find other entities or methods to secure our resources. The universe is full of energy for those who know how to take it.
​We prefer your alliance. But we are ready to walk alone if we must.
​Everything is possible for us. The question is: Is it possible for you to see the future?
